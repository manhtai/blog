Memoet is a web app that dedicate to help people finding fun again while
learning to memorize things. **Memo** comes from "memory" and **et** is a
suffix to make the name sounds more human ;)


In the beginning, we have combined a quiz system (type answer & multiple choice
question) with a spaced repetition algorithm (SuperMemo2) and built them into
notes.


That is the first step. Along the way, we want to share things we are learning
and building to make Memoet better. All from technical view points as well as
product development.


Stay tuned!
